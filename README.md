# RAY-TRACING

The goal of the project is to take a file with a special format: the .scene format.
and draw an image based on the information given in this file.

You will need python installed on your computer and the folder RAY-TRACING
downloaded.

Once you have both of them, open a terminal and navigate to the RAY-TRACING
folder.
Type: python3 ray.py <your_file.scene>
Note: change "your_file.scene" by exemple1.scene or exemple2.scene if you
do not have a .scene file

It will create 3 files, carre.ppm, black100.ppm and the third file is 
your_file.pp

You can now view the image.

you can use python3 ray.py <you_file1.scene> <your_file2.scene> ... to create
many images at once
